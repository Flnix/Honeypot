# Honeypot

---

## Overview

This project aims to develop a **simple honeypot** designed to lure, detect, and collect information about unauthorized access attempts and malicious activities. A honeypot acts as a decoy system, intentionally vulnerable, to observe and learn from attackers' tactics without risking real production systems.


---

## Core Concepts

Students working on this project will explore and implement the following key areas:

* **Network Service Emulation:** Simulating common network services (e.g., HTTP, SSH, FTP) to attract attackers.
* **Interaction Logging:** Recording detailed information about every interaction with the honeypot, including source IP, attempted commands, and exploited vulnerabilities.
* **Basic Alerting:** Implementing mechanisms to notify administrators of suspicious activity.
* **Data Analysis:** Understanding how to process and interpret the collected logs to gain insights into attack methodologies.
* **Security Best Practices:** Learning how to safely deploy and manage a honeypot without it becoming a liability.

## Expected Outcomes

By the end of this project, participants will have:

* A foundational understanding of honeypot technology and its role in cybersecurity.
* Practical skills in network programming and service emulation in Python.
* Experience in collecting and analyzing security-related log data.
* A functional prototype of a simple honeypot.

## Technologies (To be explored and chosen)

Students will have the opportunity to explore and select technologies, but common choices for this type of project include:

* **Programming Language:** Python (excellent for rapid prototyping and network interactions)
* **Networking Libraries:** `socket`, `asyncio`
* **Logging:** Python's built-in `logging` module, potentially integrating with a simple file-based or SQLite database.

## Getting Started (Initial Steps)

1.  **Research Honeypots:** Understand the different types of honeypots (low-interaction, high-interaction) and their purposes.
2.  **Set up Development Environment:** Install Python and any initial libraries.
3.  **Basic Socket Programming:** Experiment with creating simple server-client applications to understand network communication.
4.  **Service Emulation Planning:** Decide which common network services to emulate first (e.g., a simple HTTP server or an SSH banner).
